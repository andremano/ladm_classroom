# LADM in the classroom
 Datasets for teaching the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) - ISO 19512 https://www.iso.org/standard/51206.html. These datasets materialize the cases and transactions described in the 'LADM in the Classroom booklet' and, therefore, should be used in combination with it. It is currently distributed as standalone files preloaded into a QGIS project. A version based on PostgreSQL relational database management system will also be published for teaching settings where it is possible to use a server-client architecture.

 If you are interested in training concerning LADM or other land administration issues, please contact a.dasilvamano [ at ] utwente.nl or open a discussion thread in this repository.
